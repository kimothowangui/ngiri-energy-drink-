A development server should now be running. Look for a PowerShell window that was opened.

**Default URL:** http://localhost:3000

Simply open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2: Start Manually
If the server isn't running, open a terminal in this folder and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see output like:
```
  VITE v5.0.8  ready in 500 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.x.x:3000/
